# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

FILE STRUCTURE
///app
Contains the app's navigation, which is file-based. The file structure of the app directory determines the app's navigation.

The app has two routes defined by two files: app/(tabs)/index.tsx and app/(tabs)/explore.tsx. The layout file in app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx sets up the tab navigator.

///assets
The assets directory contains adaptive-icon.png used for Android and an icon.png used for iOS as app icons. It also contains splash.png which is an image for the project's splash screen and a favicon.png if the app runs in a browser.

///components
Contains React Native components, like ThemedText.tsx, which creates text elements that use the app's color scheme in light and dark modes.

///constants
Contains Colors.ts, which contains a list of color values throughout the app.

///hooks
Contains React Hooks, which allows sharing common behavior between components. For example, useThemeColor() is a hook that returns a color based on the current theme.

///scripts
Contains reset-project.js, which can be run with npm run reset-project. This script will move the app directory to app-example, and create a new app directory with an index.tsx file.

///app.json
Contains configuration options for the project and is called the app config. These options change the behavior of your project while developing, building, submitting, and updating your app.

///package.json
The package.json file contains the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata. Anytime a new dependency is added to your project, it will be added to this file.

///tsconfig.json
Contains the rules that TypeScript will use to enforce type safety throughout the project.
